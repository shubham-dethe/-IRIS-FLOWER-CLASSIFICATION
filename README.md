# -IRIS-FLOWER-CLASSIFICATION
A datascience project to classify the Iris Flower on basis of different criteria. The dataset contains measurements of various iris flowers, including their sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width, as well as their corresponding species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica.


First we import the necessary libebries such as numpy,pandas 

seaborn (Seaborn is a statistical data visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.) 
Matplotlib is a plotting library for Python. The 'pyplot' module provides a MATLAB-like interface for creating plots and visualizations.

Then we imported specific modules and classes from the scikit-learn library (sklearn) for a classification task:
train_test_split: This function is used to split datasets into train and test subsets.
LogisticRegression: This class implements logistic regression for classification tasks.
accuracy_score, confusion_matrix, classification_report, precision_score, recall_score, f1_score: These are functions for evaluating the performance of classification models.
